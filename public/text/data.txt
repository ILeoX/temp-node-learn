Here are some of the more tactical takeaways I learned that night (apart from four Tom Collinses are one too many):
Raising prices for your product every year or two and grandfathering in existing customers is a great way to increase loyalty and grow your profit margins. (We did this several times over the next few years; it worked like a charm.) If you want to raise money from an investor, ask for help with your business. If you want an investor to help with your business, ask for money. (From later experiences I can verify that, yes, this totally works.) Many voting rights for funded companies have some provision that gives special consideration to “preferred shareholders.” Usually, these are the investors, but smart entrepreneurs know this and thus will buy a small amount of preferred shares in their own companies during a funding round so they will also share these rights. The Hacker News website (https://news.ycombinator.com) has an algorithm that filters out high quantities of votes from a single geography. So if you want to ask your friends to help up-vote
something to page 1, make sure they’re not all in the same city. (Also, make friends in other cities.) Recruiting for software engineers is best done directly by founders. Find people who look interesting, uncover a connection you have to them in your network, get an intro, meet for coffee, get them excited about your company, and if they’re not interested, ask who they know who might be. Not one of the group’s members had success with external recruiters (at least, not in the early stages). Oh, and Craigslist still works way better than most of the other job sites, at least in Seattle.
